# Laser Cooling and Trapping

Light from tunable diode lasers is used to cool and trap rubidium atoms. The forces exerted by the laser light are used to hold atoms at a point in space and cool them to less than 1 mK above absolute zero. The laser spectroscopy experiment is a prerequisite for doing this experiment, and some of the same apparatus is used in both. This is best done as a “capstone” experiment i.e., as the last lab. The writeup version predates our present MOT apparatus but is correct in most particulars. Documentation for the Vescent diode lasers is useful during the setup. Here is the [Quick Setup Guide](../resources/lab-guides/laser-cooling-and-trapping/D2_QuickSetupGuide.pdf) and the [D2 Series Manual](../resources/lab-guides/laser-cooling-and-trapping/D2_Series_Manual.pdf) (which is the complete documentation for the lasers, Rb spectroscopy cells and the control electronics). There is also a brief [overview of the MiniMOT operation](../resources/lab-guides/laser-cooling-and-trapping/miniMOT_Supplement.pdf). Also here is a useful cheatsheet on the [Rubidium spectrum](../resources/lab-guides/laser-cooling-and-trapping/Rubidium_spectrum.pdf).
