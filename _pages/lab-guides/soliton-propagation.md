# Soliton Propagation

This experiment uses an electronic circuit board to illustrate the propagation of electromagnetic solitons. For the prelab problems and for understanding the behavior of the transmission lines read the following [Background Material](../resources/lab-guides/soliton-propagation/transmissionLinesAndsoliton_background_2002.pdf). Also, see the Zetex Semiconductors [datasheet](../resources/lab-guides/soliton-propagation/Zetex_830series_varactors.pdf) for the 830 series Varactor Diodes.
