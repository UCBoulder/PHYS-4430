# Earth's Field NMR

This lab introduces the precession of nuclear spins, in this case in the Earth's weak magnetic field. Due to the low field strength, precession occurs at audio frequencies (you can hear the amplified signals!). The [TeachSpin Earth's Field NMR manual](../resources/lab-guides/earths-field-nmr/Earth's field NMR Teachspin Manual.pdf)  contains the description of the apparatus and suggestions for possible measurements. An online NMR textbook is available [here](http://www.cis.rit.edu/htbooks/nmr/inside.htm) Chapters 1 and 3 may have some helpful introductory material.

# Prelab

Please read through the entire lab and figure out what your main goal will be for the lab. In your prelab, state your main goal, which should be specific and clearly defined. Then explain how you will achieve this goal. As part of this, your prelab should contain the answers to the following questions:

- What equipment are you going to use and build?
- What is the basic experimental approach?
- What are you trying to measure?
- What experimental data are you trying to model?
- What challenges do you imagine encountering and how will you overcome them?
- What sources of systematic uncertainty will be present in your measurements?

This writeup should be about 1 page.
