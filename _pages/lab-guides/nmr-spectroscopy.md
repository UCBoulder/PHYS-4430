# NMR Spectroscopy

Use NMR on organic liquids to study their structure and composition. There is some simulation code available for [Mathematica](../resources/lab-guides/nmr-spectroscopy/liquid_NMR.nb), [Matlab](../resources/lab-guides/nmr-spectroscopy/liquid_NMR.m), and [python](../resources/lab-guides/nmr-spectroscopy/liquid_NMR.py). [Here](../resources/lab-guides/nmr-spectroscopy/NMR_Spectrometer_Experiment.pdf) is the original write-up from John Price.
