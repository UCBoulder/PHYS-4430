# Laser Spectroscopy

Narrowband tunable diode lasers are used to carry out high-resolution spectroscopy of atomic rubidium. The technique of saturated absorption spectroscopy will be studied to obtain resolution greater than the Doppler width of the resonance lines. The excited state hyperfine structure will be measured. You may also want to look at this [older version](../resources/lab-guides/laser-spectroscopy/LaserSpectroscopy.pdf) of the lab from a time when the diode laser sources were home-made. You can use the [manual](../resources/lab-guides/laser-spectroscopy/New Focus Vortex 6000 Laser Controller.pdf) for the Vortex 6000 Laser Controller.  Also [here](../resources/lab-guides/laser-spectroscopy/Rubidium_spectrum.pdf) is a useful cheat sheet on the Rubidium spectrum.
