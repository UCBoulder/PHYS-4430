# Pulsed NMR

The dynamic behavior of nuclear spins is investigated using pulsed magnetic resonance techniques. Spin echoes and spin relaxation rates are studied in various samples. A [Pulsed NMR Conceptual Tour](../resources/lab-guides/pulsed-nmr/PulsedNMR_Conceptual_Tour.pdf) is available from TeachSpin. An online NMR textbook is available [here](http://www.cis.rit.edu/htbooks/nmr/inside.htm). Chapter 3 briefly covers the relaxation rates, 6 covers the pulse sequences, and 7 covers the NMR hardware.  For fun, [here](../resources/lab-guides/pulsed-nmr/PulsedNMR.pdf) is an older pulsed NMR version.

# Prelab

Please read through the entire lab and figure out what your main goal will be for the lab. In your prelab, state your main goal, which should be specific and clearly defined. Then explain how you will achieve this goal. As part of this, your prelab should contain the answers to the following questions:

- What equipment are you going to use and build?
- What is the basic experimental approach?
- What are you trying to measure?
- What experimental data are you trying to model?
- What challenges do you imagine encountering and how will you overcome them?
- What sources of systematic uncertainty will be present in your measurements?

This writeup should be about 1 page.
