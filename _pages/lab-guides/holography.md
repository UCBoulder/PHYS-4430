# Holography

Expose and reconstruct a two-beam transmission hologram. The physics of polymeric holography plates is fascinating and is often kept strictly secret by companies that sell these materials. We usually will use commercially available 'self-developing' holography plates. Here are two papers ([paper 1](../resources/lab-guides/holography/Model of hologram formation in pp Colvin 1997.pdf) and [paper 2](../resources/lab-guides/holography/Recording media that exhibit high dynamic range for digital holographic data storage Dhar 1999.pdf)) that describe how some of these systems work. Also, here is the [information provided by Litiholo](../resources/lab-guides/holography/litiholo_information.pdf) in their holography kits. They suggest a simple geometry for quick holograms. *Give their geometry a try first to learn how the plates work.* Then move on to the full holography experiment. Specifications sheets for the Litiholo plates are available for [C-RT20 plates](../resources/lab-guides/holography/LitiholoCRT20Spec.pdf) and [R-RT20 plates](../resources/lab-guides/holography/LitiholoRRT20Spec.pdf).
