# Modeling and Measuring the Polarization of Light: From Jones Matrices to Ellipsometry

Experimentally develop the Jones Matrix formalism for polarized light and apply it to model experimental data using polarizing filters and quarter wave plates. The lab also experimentally tests and models the reflection of polarized light from a dielectric surface in two ways: first, using the "Fresnel equations" for a model, and second, as a simple ellipsometric measurement (a technique commonly used to measure properties of thin films). For Question 7, you will need [this CSV file](../resources/lab-guides/modeling-and-measuring-the-polarization-of-light/Test_Polarization_Data.csv).
