# X-Ray Fluorescence

Use an x-ray source and detector to measure various materials and determine their composition. You should also consult [this](../resources/lab-guides/x-ray-fluorescence/more_xrf.pdf) supplemental lab writeup, which has more information about how to use the software and additional suggestions for quantitative studies that you should do.

# Prelab

Please read through the entire lab and figure out what your main goal will be for the lab. In your prelab, state your main goal, which should be specific and clearly defined. Then explain how you will achieve this goal. As part of this, your prelab should contain the answers to the following questions:

- What equipment are you going to use and build?
- What is the basic experimental approach?
- What are you trying to measure?
- What experimental data are you trying to model?
- What challenges do you imagine encountering and how will you overcome them?
- What sources of systematic uncertainty will be present in your measurements?

This writeup should be about 1 page.
