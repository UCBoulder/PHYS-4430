# Raman Spectroscopy

Use a laser and a sensitive optical spectrometer to study how inelastic light scattering can tell you about the quantum mechanical excitations inside molecules and materials. Light usually scatters from mirrors and surfaces with the same colors as the incident sources provided, but not always! When light scatters and comes out with different colors than were originally incident, the change in color implies that the light gained or lost energy during the scattering. Those changes in energy tell you about energy quanta that were picked up or deposited during the scattering. See quantum mechanics at work!

# Prelab

Please read through the entire lab and figure out what your main goal will be for the lab. In your prelab, state your main goal, which should be specific and clearly defined. Then explain how you will achieve this goal. As part of this, your prelab should contain the answers to the following questions:

- What equipment are you going to use and build?
- What is the basic experimental approach?
- What are you trying to measure?
- What experimental data are you trying to model?
- What challenges do you imagine encountering and how will you overcome them?
- What sources of systematic uncertainty will be present in your measurements?

This writeup should be about 1 page.
