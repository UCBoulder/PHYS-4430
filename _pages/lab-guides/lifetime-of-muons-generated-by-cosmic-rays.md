# Lifetime of Muons Generated by Cosmic Rays

This experiment uses a large plastic scintillator with an attached photomultiplier tube. Cosmic rays are studied by observing the light pulses they produce in the scintillator. A variety of fast timing electronics and coincidence circuits are used to obtain information about the composition. Measurement of the muon lifetime measurement is a good first effort. See [this](../resources/lab-guides/lifetime-of-muons-generated-by-cosmic-rays/AmJPhysics_RistinenMuonLifetime.pdf) useful paper.
