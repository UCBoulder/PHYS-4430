PHYS 4430, Advanced Laboratory at the University of Colorado Boulder, is designed to expose you to and equip you with some of the essential skills that an experimentalist should have. It is also designed to expose you to a variety of experimental physics topics, and to provide a sense of independent research.

The first 10 weeks of the course consists of five guided experiments. A short oral presentation or written report follows the completion of each of these five experiments. About mid-semester, students individually or in small teams begin to conceive of independent experimental research projects covering any field relevant to experimental physics. This project is the focus of weeks 11-15. The instructors make every effort to support original and creative projects. At the end of the semester, the student submits a written project report and also gives an oral presentation.

## Meeting Times and Information

**Lectures:** Lectures are on Tuesday and Thursday each week in the classroom of Duane G214. See below for the lecture times for each section. Lectures will not be recorded but the slides used will be [posted in Canvas](https://canvas.colorado.edu/).

- Section 200 - Tuesdays and Thursdays from 9:00 am to 9:50 am
- Section 100 - Tuesdays and Thursdays from 1:00 pm to 1:50 pm

**Lab Sessions:** Each section has one three-hour instructional lab session per week, supervised by your lab instructor. You must attend the weekly scheduled lab session that corresponds with the section you are enrolled in. 

- Section 201 - Tuesdays from 10:00 am to 12:50 pm
- Section 101 - Thursdays from 2:00 pm to 4:50 pm

## Textbook and Reference Materials

*There is no required textbook for this course.* The following textbooks are available in the lab for your reference (please do not remove them from the lab). 

- ***Experiments in Modern Physics**, A. Melissinos and J. Napolitano, Academic Press, 2nd ed., 2003*. (The 1st edition from 1966 is dated in some parts but still very useful.) 
- ***The Art of Experimental Physics**, D. W. Preston and E. R. Dietz, John Wiley & Sons, 1991.* This is extremely useful for the basic skills in experimental physics. 
- ***Building Scientific Apparatus**: A practical guide to design and construction*, *John H. Moore, Christopher C. Davis and Michael A. Coplan, Perseus Books, Cambridge, MA, 3rd edition, 2003.* This text is a valuable resource for experimentalists. Although there are no planned specific assignments from the book, its utility will vastly outlive the semester.

## Group Work

Students can anticipate working in small groups (typically two students per group) throughout the semester. For the first guided lab (Gaussian Laser Beams), students will choose their groups. Groups for the remainder of the guided labs will be assigned based on your requested lab experiments and other factors. It can be expected that group assignments will not be static for each guided lab. Students also work in small groups for the final project, although some students do work independently on this portion of the course. This is determined later in the semester by a collaboration between the students, instructors, and technical staff when the final project ideas are realized.

Lab notebooks, prelab assignments, lab skill activities, and written reports should be your own work. If you work on the oral presentation together, submitting identical presentations is allowed. For final project proposal draft, proposal, project report and presentations, one submission per team should be fine.

## Lab Organization

The laboratory equipment, electronic and optical components, and tools are organized and labeled. The optics rooms and the electronics lab are equipped with kits of components for the standard experiments. There is a single location in the lab for other components or equipment. Please tour the lab and familiarize yourself with the location of these items.

The lab is to be maintained in the condition in which it begins the semester. Of course, while equipment, tools and components can be collected and kept during the course of an experiment, they are to be returned to their homes when the experiment is finished.

If you have any questions, please reach out to the technical staff. They are here to help and welcome all questions. 

## Lab Availability and Use

The course will go much more smoothly (and quickly) for you if you are well prepared for each lab session so you can get most of the work done while your instructor is available to help. Remember to clean up your area when you are finished as the space is shared between all the lab sections. Communal equipment, including meters, stop watches, tools from the bench, cables, etc. should be returned to their storage locations. The lab is open for unsupervised work any time the building wing is open, and when no other session is in progress. These times are available for you to complete unfinished experiments or to explore your own ideas. Your Buff One Card will open the lab door. Please do not prop open the lab door or the hallway barrier door: doing so will result in a warning and then loss of keycard access to the lab. If you are the last to leave the lab, please turn off all equipment, close any windows, turn off the lights, and make sure the door closes and latches when you leave the lab. 

## Broken and/or Malfunctioning Equipment

Lab equipment may fail, malfunction, or become damaged throughout the semester. If this happens, please report it to the lab technical staff by completing [this form](https://canvas.colorado.edu/courses/88986/pages/report-lab-issue) and report it to you instructor. The lab issue form allows you to also submit attachments which helps the technical staff identify and troubleshoot the issue. 

## Machine Shop Course

As part of your enrollment in this course, we offer to cover the costs associated with taking the [Machining Course](https://www.colorado.edu/physics/partners/trades-teaching-lab/classes) in the [Physics Trades Teaching Lab](https://www.colorado.edu/physics/partners/trades-teaching-lab). While this is not a requirement, we strongly encourage all students to participate in this opportunity. More details will be provided later in the semester.
