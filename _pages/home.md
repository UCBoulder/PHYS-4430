PHYS 4430, Advanced Laboratory at the University of Colorado Boulder, is designed to expose you to and equip you with some of the essential skills that an experimentalist should have. It is also designed to expose you to a variety of experimental physics topics, and to provide a sense of independent research.

In the first part of the course you will cover several guided experiments of your choosing. A short oral presentation or written report follows the completion of each of these guided experiments. About mid-semester, students individually or in small teams begin to conceive of independent experimental research projects covering any field relevant to experimental physics. The instructors make every effort to support original and creative projects. At the end of the semester, the student submits a written project report and also gives an oral presentation.

## Meeting Times and Information

**Lectures:** Lectures are on Tuesday and Thursday each week in the classroom of Duane G214. See below for the lecture times for each section. Lectures will not be recorded but the slides used will be [posted in Canvas](https://canvas.colorado.edu/).

- Section 100 - Tuesdays and Thursdays from 9:00 am to 9:50 am
- Section 200 - Tuesdays and Thursdays from 1:00 pm to 1:50 pm

**Lab Sessions:** Each section has one three-hour instructional lab session per week, supervised by your lab instructor. You must attend the weekly scheduled lab session that corresponds with the section you are enrolled in. 

- Section 101 - Tuesdays from 10:00 am to 12:50 pm
- Section 201 - Tuesdays from 2:00 pm to 4:50 pm

*Not all sections listed above are offered each semester. Be sure to visit [classes.colorado.edu](https://classes.colorado.edu) for the currently offered sections.*

## Textbook and Reference Materials

*There is no required textbook for this course.* The following textbooks are available in the lab for your reference (please do not remove them from the lab). 

- ***Experiments in Modern Physics**, A. Melissinos and J. Napolitano, Academic Press, 2nd ed., 2003*. (The 1st edition from 1966 is dated in some parts but still very useful.) 
- ***The Art of Experimental Physics**, D. W. Preston and E. R. Dietz, John Wiley & Sons, 1991.* This is extremely useful for the basic skills in experimental physics. 
- ***Building Scientific Apparatus**: A practical guide to design and construction*, *John H. Moore, Christopher C. Davis and Michael A. Coplan, Perseus Books, Cambridge, MA, 3rd edition, 2003.* This text is a valuable resource for experimentalists. Although there are no planned specific assignments from the book, its utility will vastly outlive the semester.


## Broken and/or Malfunctioning Equipment

Lab equipment may fail, malfunction, or become damaged throughout the semester. If this happens, please report it to the lab technical staff by completing [this form](/PHYS-4430/report-lab-issue) and report it to you instructor. The lab issue form allows you to also submit attachments which helps the technical staff identify and troubleshoot the issue. 

## Machine Shop Course

As part of your enrollment in this course, we offer to cover the costs associated with taking the [Machining Course](https://www.colorado.edu/physics/partners/trades-teaching-lab/classes) in the [Physics Trades Teaching Lab](https://www.colorado.edu/physics/partners/trades-teaching-lab). While this is not a requirement, we strongly encourage all students to participate in this opportunity. More details will be provided later in the semester.
