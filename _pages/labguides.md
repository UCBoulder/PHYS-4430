# Guided Labs

The first guided lab of this course is [Gaussian Beams](/PHYS-4430/lab-guides/gaussian-beams) which will be completed in the first four weeks of the semester. 

For the experiments with a * in front, there is a write-up that provides a description of the equipment and the physical phenomena involved. It also gives a set of measurement goals, but usually not a detailed procedure. You must develop your own procedure for best achieving these goals. All of these experiments are somewhat openâ€‘ended in that they offer opportunities for you to pursue additional research topics, and you are encouraged to investigate additional topics of your own choosing. All the experiments typically take 2 weeks to complete if you do the basic minimum experiment. This assumes you put in something like 6 hours per week in the lab and prepare ahead of time. If you pursue additional topics (with the permission of the instructor) they can take much longer.
