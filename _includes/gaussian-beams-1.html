         Sequence</h1>
         <p><strong>Week 1 of 4: Foundations</strong></p>
         <p>This week you build the foundational skills for the entire
         Gaussian Beams sequence: optical alignment, photodetector
         operation, and beam width measurement. The calibration data and
         measurement techniques you develop this week will be used
         directly in Weeks 2-4.</p>
         <p><strong>This week:</strong> Align optics → Calibrate
         photodetector → Measure beam width</p>
         <p><strong>Next week:</strong> Learn data acquisition →
         Characterize noise → Choose optimal gain setting</p>
         <h1 data-number="2" id="learning-goals"><span
         class="header-section-number">2</span> Learning Goals</h1>
         <p>After completing this week’s lab, you will be able to:</p>
         <ol type="1">
         <li>Mount and align optical components (mirrors, lenses) using
         standard optomechanical hardware.</li>
         <li>Walk a laser beam to achieve parallel propagation using two
         mirrors.</li>
         <li>Explain how a photodiode converts photons to current via
         the photoelectric effect.</li>
         <li>Calculate expected photodetector output voltage given
         incident power, responsivity, and gain setting.</li>
         <li>Calibrate a photodetector’s offset and gain and compare to
         manufacturer specifications.</li>
         <li>Estimate measurement uncertainty using statistical sampling
         and explain why repeated measurements improve precision.</li>
         <li>Set up a knife-edge measurement and derive the theoretical
         model (error function).</li>
         <li><em>(If time permits)</em> Apply a curve fit to test data
         to verify your analysis code is ready for real
         measurements.</li>

         class="header-section-number">3</span> Overview of Your
         Work</h1>
         <p>This week you’ll build the foundation for the entire lab
         sequence. Your work centers on three activities:</p>
         <p><strong>1. Build and align your optical setup.</strong>
         You’ll mount a laser and mirrors, then use the “walking the
         beam” technique to achieve parallel propagation. Document your
         setup with a diagram—you’ll refer back to this in later
         weeks.</p>
         <p><strong>2. Understand and calibrate your
         photodetector.</strong> Before you can trust voltage readings,
         you need to know how the detector behaves. You’ll measure
         offset voltages at each gain setting and verify that gain
         ratios match the datasheet. This calibration enables you to
         combine measurements taken at different gain settings.</p>
         <p><strong>3. Characterize measurement uncertainty.</strong>
         You’ll observe voltage fluctuations, identify their character
         (random noise vs. drift), and make decisions about your
         measurement strategy for beam profiling.</p>
         <p><strong>If time permits:</strong> Begin knife-edge beam
         width measurements. If not, you’ll complete this in Week 3.</p>

         this guide.</em></p>

         of optical components</h2>
         <p>It’s very important that you <strong>do not handle optical
         components</strong> (lenses, mirrors, polarizers, wave plates,
         beam splitters, etc.) <strong>with your bare hands</strong>.
         The oils on your skin can damage the optics and degrade the
         light in your experiment. Always handle these components while
         using <strong>latex/nitrile gloves or finger cots</strong>,
         which can be found on the top of the tool cabinets in your
         optics bay, or on top of the black drawer cabinets in the main
         lab. This <a
         href="https://www.newport.com/n/how-to-clean-optics">technical
         note</a> from Newport discusses how to go about cleaning dirty
         optics, and is also demonstrated in <a
         href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Pq4SeNmFYw">this
         video</a>. For a more in-depth treatment on cleaning optics, we
         have a copy of <a
         href="https://spie.org/Publications/Book/2518746?SSO=1">“The
         Proper Care of Optics: Cleaning, Handling, Storage, and

         should be located on top of the black tool cabinets in the main

         how to use and mount components on the optical breadboards that
         we have in the lab. Please watch these before proceeding.</p>

         <p>Now, we will begin assembling the components.</p>
         <ol type="1">
         <li>Get a laser and power supply from the “He-Ne Laser” drawer
         in the colored drawer cabinet found in your chosen or assigned
         optics bay. You’ll also need two sets of 3D-printed laser tube
         mounts which you can find in the same drawer (see Figure <a
         href="#fig:tube-mount">1</a>). The bottom mount first gets
         mounted to an optical post and then the top of the mount can be
         assembled with ¼-20 socket head cap screw and nut. After both
         sets of tube mounts are attached to the laser, insert the
         optical posts into post holders and attach the assembly to the
         optical table. We recommend placing the laser towards the rear
         of the optical table (under the shelf), oriented so the beam
         travels along the length of the table (parallel to the shelf).
         This layout leaves the front of the table clear for mounting
         the photodetector and translation stage you’ll add later.</li>
         <li>Each person in your group is responsible for assembling a
         mirror as shown in Figure <a href="#fig:mount-assembley">2</a>.
         In the end, you will need at least 2 mirrors to complete the
         next task. <strong>Remember to wear latex/nitrile gloves or
         finger cots while handling optical components.</strong> Mount
         one mirror at the far end of the table (opposite the laser) and
         the second closer to you, so that the laser beam propagates
         across the table and gives you plenty of space to mount
         additional components.</li>
         </ol>
         <p><em>As you are mounting the optics, choose the heights so
         that the laser hits the center of each optic and the beam is
         parallel to the table.</em></p>

         and improved, a process more commonly called “calibration.”
         Note that there are <strong>two</strong> power switches, one on
         the power supply and one on the photodetector. The

         class="header-section-number">8.2</span> Calibrating the
         photodetector offset and gain</h2>
         <p>Calibrating the photodetector is essential when working with
         multiple gain settings. Imagine you’re measuring beam width
         later today (or in Week 4’s automated measurements): at one
         position the signal saturates at 40 dB gain, but gives good
         readings at 30 dB. How would you combine these measurements
         onto a single scale? That’s what calibration enables—it lets
         you stitch data from different gain settings together
         accurately.</p>
         <ol type="1">
         <li><p>The photodetector gain is specified in <strong>decibels
         (dB)</strong>, a logarithmic scale commonly used in
         electronics. Here’s how it works:</p>
         <p><strong>The definition:</strong> For voltage gain, <span
         class="math display">\[dB = 20 \times
         \log_{10}\left(\frac{V_{out}}{V_{in}}\right)\]</span></p>
         <p><strong>What does log₁₀ mean?</strong> The function <span
         class="math inline">\(\log_{10}(x)\)</span> asks: “10 raised to
         what power equals <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span>?” For
         example:</p>
         <ul>
         <li><span class="math inline">\(\log_{10}(10) = 1\)</span>
         because <span class="math inline">\(10^1 = 10\)</span></li>
         <li><span class="math inline">\(\log_{10}(100) = 2\)</span>
         because <span class="math inline">\(10^2 = 100\)</span></li>
         <li><span class="math inline">\(\log_{10}(1000) = 3\)</span>
         because <span class="math inline">\(10^3 = 1000\)</span></li>
         </ul>
         <p><br></p>
         <p><strong>Converting dB to linear gain:</strong> To find the
         actual gain from a dB value, invert the formula: <span
         class="math display">\[\text{voltage gain} =
         10^{dB/20}\]</span></p>
         <p>For example, 20 dB corresponds to <span
         class="math inline">\(10^{20/20} = 10^1 = 10\times\)</span>
         gain.</p>
         <p><strong>Important: What “0 dB” means on the PDA36A.</strong>
         On this photodetector, “0 dB” does <em>not</em> mean “no
         amplification.” The 0 dB setting has a transimpedance gain of
         1.51 × 10³ V/A—this is the baseline. The dB labels indicate
         gain <em>relative to this baseline</em>: the 20 dB setting has
         10× more gain than 0 dB, the 40 dB setting has 100× more, and
         so on.</p>
         <p><strong>Build your intuition:</strong> Predict the linear
         gain for 40 dB before moving the slider below, then check your
         answer. Try a few values until the conversion feels
         natural.</p></li>

         <p>The offset voltage is the photodetector’s output when no

         change with gain?</p></li>
         <li><p><strong>Compare to datasheet:</strong> The datasheet

         <li><p><strong>Absolute vs. relative gain:</strong> The

         <em>changes</em> between settings (relative gain)? Explain your

         Calculate how many measurements would give you 1% relative

         <p>These decisions matter for your beam width measurement. If
         drift is present during a knife-edge scan, it could
         systematically bias your fitted beam width. If you’re averaging
         at each position, you’re trading measurement time for
         precision.</p>

         Width</h1>
         <p>The goal of this section is to develop a measurement
         technique and analysis scheme to measure the width of a laser
         beam. The scheme will let you measure the width in one
         dimension. The technique is most useful for beams that have an
         approximately Gaussian intensity profile. You will improve and
         refine this technique in the upcoming weeks of this lab.</p>
         <p><strong>Time management note:</strong> This section has
         multiple parts with different priorities:</p>
         <ol type="1">
         <li><p><strong>Essential (must complete):</strong> Derive the
         error function model and answer the required questions in

         critical preparation for Week 2.</p></li>
         <li><p><strong>Important (complete if time allows):</strong>
         Build the setup and take data. If you don’t finish in Week 1,
         you will complete this in Week 3.</p></li>
         <li><p><strong>Optional (good practice):</strong> Try the curve
         fitting practice exercise with test data. This prepares you for
         Week 2, but fitting is covered in detail in Week 2’s
         prelab.</p></li>

         <p>The basic scheme involves measuring the power in the laser
         beam as the beam is gradually blocked by a knife edge (razor
         blade) using a setup similar to Figure <a

         <li>Your photodetector offset voltage differs from the
         datasheet by 15%. What would you do before using this detector
         for precision measurements?
         <ul>
         <li>Options: (a) Repeat the measurement, (b) Accept the
         datasheet value, (c) Investigate the cause, (d) Use your
         measured value</li>
         <li>Justify your choice in 2-3 sentences.</li>
         </ul></li>
         <li>You took 10 measurements and calculated both σ (standard
         deviation) and σ_mean (standard deviation of the mean). Which
         would you report as the uncertainty in your voltage
         measurement? Why?</li>
