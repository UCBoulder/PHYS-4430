         of optical components</h2>
         <p>It’s very important that you <strong>do not handle optical
         components</strong> (lenses, mirrors, polarizers, wave plates,
         beam splitters, etc.) <strong>with your bare hands</strong>.
         The oils on your skin can damage the optics and degrade the
         light in your experiment. Always handle these components while
         using <strong>latex/nitrile gloves or finger cots</strong>,
         which can be found on the top of the tool cabinets in your
         optics bay, or on top of the black drawer cabinets in the main
         lab. This <a
         href="https://www.newport.com/n/how-to-clean-optics">technical
         note</a> from Newport discusses how to go about cleaning dirty
         optics, and is also demonstrated in <a
         href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Pq4SeNmFYw">this
         video</a>. For a more in-depth treatment on cleaning optics, we
         have a copy of <a

         we have in the lab. Please watch these before proceeding.</p>

         <p>Now, we will begin assembling the components.</p>
         <ol type="1">
         <li>Get a laser and power supply from the “He-Ne Laser” drawer
         in the colored drawer cabinet found in your chosen or assigned
         optics bay. You’ll also need two sets of 3D-printed laser tube
         mounts which you can find in the same drawer (see Figure <a
         href="#fig:tube-mount">1</a>). The bottom mount first gets
         mounted to an optical post and then the top of the mount can be
         assembled with ¼-20 socket head cap screw and nut. After both
         sets of tube mounts are attached to the laser, insert the
         optical posts into post holders and attach the assembly to the
         optical table. We recommend placing the laser towards the rear
         of the optical table (under the shelf), oriented so the beam
         travels along the length of the table (parallel to the shelf).
         This layout leaves the front of the table clear for mounting
         the photodetector and translation stage you’ll add later.</li>
         <li>Each person in your group is responsible for assembling a
         mirror as shown in Figure <a href="#fig:mount-assembley">2</a>.
         In the end, you will need at least 2 mirrors to complete the
         next task. <strong>Remember to wear latex/nitrile gloves or
         finger cots while handling optical components.</strong> Mount
         one mirror at the far end of the table (opposite the laser) and
         the second closer to you, so that the laser beam propagates
         across the table and gives you plenty of space to mount
         additional components.</li>
         </ol>
         <p><em>As you are mounting the optics, choose the heights so
         that the laser hits the center of each optic and the beam is
         parallel to the table.</em></p>

         class="header-section-number">6.3</span> Walking a beam</h2>
         <p>Next, you will align your laser such that beam is aligned
         parallel to the table. You will do this by using two mirrors
         and a technique that is called “walking a beam”. <a
         href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qzxILY6nOmA&amp;t=249s">This
         video</a> provides an overview on how to do so. The most
         relevant information for our lab starts at 4:09 (which the
         above link should take you to). Also, we have 3D printed beam
         alignment tools that are used in place of the iris in the video
         (these can be found in the colored drawer cabinet in your
         optics bay).</p>
         <ol type="1">
         <li>Mount two 3D printed beam alignment discs onto the optical
         table at the same height above the table.</li>
         <li>Use only two mirrors to get the beam to pass through the
         center of each disc. Having two mirrors allows you to
         independently adjust the angle and position of your beam.</li>
         <li>Draw a diagram in your lab notebook of the configuration of
         your laser, mirrors, and alignment discs.</li>

         about the specifications given on the datasheet for the
         Thorlabs <a

         Switchable Gain Amplified Photodetectors (we have both in the
         lab, so check the model number to know which one you are
         using). It is important to realize that data sheets (also
         called spec sheets or specification sheets) provide a model for
         the realistic behavior of the device. This model can be tested
         and improved, a process more commonly called “calibration.”
         Note that there are <strong>two</strong> power switches, one on
         the power supply and one on the photodetector. The
         photodetector will respond to light with the power off but it
         won’t work well and changing the gain will have little
         effect.</p>

         explanation using words and diagrams to explain the physical

         class="header-section-number">7.2</span> Calibrating the
         photodetector offset and gain</h2>
         <p>Calibrating the photodetector is essential when working with
         multiple gain settings. Imagine you’re measuring beam width
         later today (or in Week 4’s automated measurements): at one
         position the signal saturates at 40 dB gain, but gives good
         readings at 30 dB. How would you combine these measurements
         onto a single scale? That’s what calibration enables—it lets
         you stitch data from different gain settings together
         accurately.</p>
         <ol type="1">
         <li><p>The photodetector gain is specified in <strong>decibels
         (dB)</strong>, a logarithmic scale commonly used in
         electronics. Here’s how it works:</p>
         <p><strong>The definition:</strong> For voltage gain, <span
         class="math display">\[dB = 20 \times
         \log_{10}\left(\frac{V_{out}}{V_{in}}\right)\]</span></p>
         <p><strong>What does log₁₀ mean?</strong> The function <span
         class="math inline">\(\log_{10}(x)\)</span> asks: “10 raised to
         what power equals <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span>?” For
         example:</p>
         <ul>
         <li><span class="math inline">\(\log_{10}(10) = 1\)</span>
         because <span class="math inline">\(10^1 = 10\)</span></li>
         <li><span class="math inline">\(\log_{10}(100) = 2\)</span>
         because <span class="math inline">\(10^2 = 100\)</span></li>
         <li><span class="math inline">\(\log_{10}(1000) = 3\)</span>
         because <span class="math inline">\(10^3 = 1000\)</span></li>
         </ul>
         <p><br></p>
         <p><strong>Converting dB to linear gain:</strong> To find the
         actual gain from a dB value, invert the formula: <span
         class="math display">\[\text{voltage gain} =
         10^{dB/20}\]</span></p>
         <p>For example, 20 dB corresponds to <span
         class="math inline">\(10^{20/20} = 10^1 = 10\times\)</span>
         gain.</p>
         <p><strong>Important: What “0 dB” means on the PDA36A.</strong>
         On this photodetector, “0 dB” does <em>not</em> mean “no
         amplification.” The 0 dB setting has a transimpedance gain of
         1.51 × 10³ V/A—this is the baseline. The dB labels indicate
         gain <em>relative to this baseline</em>: the 20 dB setting has
         10× more gain than 0 dB, the 40 dB setting has 100× more, and
         so on.</p>
         <p><strong>Build your intuition:</strong> Predict the linear
         gain for 40 dB before moving the slider below, then check your
         answer. Try a few values until the conversion feels
         natural.</p></li>

         <p><em>You might not get this immediately—that’s fine. Discuss
         with your partner or revisit after completing the

         <li><p>Calibrating the offset voltage.</p>
         <p>The offset voltage is the photodetector’s output when no
         light is incident on the sensor. You’ll need to subtract this

         <ol type="1">
         <li><p><strong>Measure the offset:</strong> Block all light

         change with gain?</p></li>
         <li><p><strong>Compare to datasheet:</strong> The datasheet
         specifies typical and maximum offset values for each gain

         <li><p>Calibrating the gain.</p>
         <ol type="1">
         <li><p><strong>Absolute vs. relative gain:</strong> The
         datasheet specifies gain in V/A (volts out per amp of
         photocurrent in). Can you measure this absolute gain with the
         equipment available, or can you only measure how gain
         <em>changes</em> between settings (relative gain)? Explain your
         reasoning. <em>(Note: This lab only requires relative
         gain.)</em></p></li>
         <li><p><strong>Measure relative gain:</strong> Choose a light
         level where the detector doesn’t saturate at your highest gain
         setting—you may need to partially block the beam. Then measure
         output voltage at several gain settings (e.g., 0, 10, 20, 30,
         40 dB) without changing anything else. Calculate the gain ratio
         between adjacent settings.</p>

         <li><p><strong>Compare to datasheet:</strong> The datasheet
         lists expected gain ratios between settings (each 10 dB step

         transimpedance gain, estimate your laser’s output power from
         your measured voltage. Does this agree with the power labeled
         on the laser? If not, what might explain the

         <p>Now use the oscilloscope’s built-in RMS measurement function
         to measure the fluctuations automatically.</p>
         <ul>
         <li>Oscilloscope RMS reading: ______ V</li>

         <li><p>Your standard deviation of the mean (<span

         <p>Measurement uncertainty isn’t a sign of failure—it’s
         essential information about how much you can trust your data.
         In Week 2, you’ll learn to characterize noise more
         systematically and use uncertainty to make quantitative
         decisions about your experimental setup.</p>

         class="header-section-number">9</span> Measuring the Beam
         Width</h1>
         <p>The goal of this section is to develop a measurement
         technique and analysis scheme to measure the width of a laser
         beam. The scheme will let you measure the width in one
         dimension. The technique is most useful for beams that have an
         approximately Gaussian intensity profile. You will improve and
         refine this technique in the upcoming weeks of this lab.</p>
         <p><strong>Time management note:</strong> This section has
         multiple parts with different priorities:</p>
         <ol type="1">
         <li><p><strong>Essential (must complete):</strong> Derive the
         error function model and complete the curve fitting practice
         (“Before you take data” subsection). This analysis is critical
         preparation for Week 2.</p></li>
         <li><p><strong>Important (complete if time allows):</strong>
         Build the setup and take data. If you don’t finish in Week 1,
         you will complete this in Week 3.</p></li>
         <li><p><strong>Good practice:</strong> If you take data,
         complete the analysis. This validates your fitting code on real
         data.</p></li>
         </ol>
         <p>The basic scheme involves measuring the power in the laser
         beam as the beam is gradually blocked by a knife edge (razor
         blade) using a setup similar to Figure <a
         href="#fig:knife-assembley">3</a>.</p>
