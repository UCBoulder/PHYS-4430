         <p><strong>Week 1 of 4: Foundations</strong></p>
         <p>This week you build the foundational skills for the entire
         Gaussian Beams sequence: optical alignment, photodetector
         operation, uncertainty estimation, and beam width measurement.
         The calibration data and measurement techniques you develop
         this week will be used directly in Weeks 2-4.</p>
         <p><strong>This week:</strong> Align optics → Calibrate
         photodetector → Learn uncertainty methods → Measure beam width
         <strong>Next week:</strong> Learn data acquisition →
         Characterize noise → Choose optimal gain setting</p>
         <h1 data-number="2" id="learning-goals"><span
         class="header-section-number">2</span> Learning Goals</h1>
         <p>After completing this week’s lab, you will be able to:</p>

         <p><strong>Optic</strong> – Any optical component that
         manipulates the light in some way. Examples include lenses,
         mirrors, polarizing filters, beam splitters, etc.</p>
         <p><strong>Optomechanics</strong> – This category includes
         optics mounts and the components to align them. Examples in the

         <p>Your group should find an empty optical breadboard
         workstation in one of the five color coded optics bays in
         G-214. Spend some time to explore the space and familiarize
         yourself with the components. The shelf above the breadboard
         should have:</p>
         <ul>
         <li>An oscilloscope</li>
         <li>A waveform generator</li>
         <li>Triple output DC Power Supply</li>

         class="header-section-number">5.1</span> Cleaning and handling
         of optical components</h2>
         <p>It’s very important that you <strong>do not handle optical
         components</strong> (lenses, mirrors, polarizers, wave plates,
         beam splitters, etc.) <strong>with your bare hands</strong>.
         The oils on your skin can damage the optics and degrade the
         light in your experiment. Always handle these components while
         using <strong>latex/nitrile gloves or finger cots</strong>,
         which can be found on the top of the tool cabinets in your
         optics bay, or on top of the black drawer cabinets in the main
         lab. This <a
         href="https://www.newport.com/n/how-to-clean-optics">technical
         note</a> from Newport discusses how to go about cleaning dirty
         optics, and is also demonstrated in <a
         href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Pq4SeNmFYw">this
         video</a>. For a more in-depth treatment on cleaning optics, we
         have a copy of <a
         href="https://spie.org/Publications/Book/2518746?SSO=1">“The
         Proper Care of Optics: Cleaning, Handling, Storage, and
         Shipping” by Robert Schalck</a> for reference in the lab (it
         should be located on top of the black tool cabinets in the main
         lab).</p>

         how to use and mount components on the optical breadboards that
         we have in the lab. Please watch these before proceeding.</p>

         <p>Now, we will begin assembling the components.</p>
         <ol type="1">
         <li>Get a laser and power supply from the “He-Ne Laser” drawer
         in the colored drawer cabinet found in your chosen or assigned
         optics bay. You’ll also need two sets of 3D-printed laser tube
         mounts which you can find in the same drawer (see Figure <a
         href="#fig:tube-mount">1</a>). The bottom mount first gets
         mounted to an optical post and then the top of the mount can be
         assembled with ¼-20 socket head cap screw and nut. After both
         sets of tube mounts are attached to the laser, insert the
         optical posts into post holders and attach the assembly to the
         optical table.</li>
         <li>Each person in your group is responsible for assembling a
         mirror as shown in Figure <a href="#fig:mount-assembley">2</a>.
         In the end, you will need at least 2 mirrors to complete the
         next task. <strong>Remember to wear latex/nitrile gloves or
         finger cots while handling optical components.</strong></li>
         </ol>
         <p><em>As you are mounting the optics, choose the heights so
         that the laser hits the center of each optic and the beam is
         parallel to the table.</em></p>

         <p>Next, you will align your laser such that beam is aligned
         parallel to the table. You will do this by using two mirrors
         and a technique that is called “walking a beam”. <a
         href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qzxILY6nOmA&amp;t=249s">This
         video</a> provides an overview on how to do so. The most
         relevant information for our lab starts at 4:09 (which the
         above link should take you to). Also, we have 3D printed beam
         alignment tools that are used in place of the iris in the video
         (these can be found in the colored drawer cabinet in your
         optics bay).</p>
         <ol type="1">
         <li>Mount two 3D printed beam alignment discs onto the optical
         table at the same height above the table.</li>
         <li>Use only two mirrors to get the beam to pass through the
         center of each disc. Having two mirrors allows you to
         independently adjust the angle and position of your beam.</li>
         <li>Draw a diagram in your lab notebook of the configuration of
         your laser, mirrors, and alignment discs.</li>

         of the Photodetector</h1>
         <p>The goal of this part of the lab is to understand a lot
         about the specifications given on the datasheet for the
         Thorlabs <a
         href="../resources/lab-guides/gaussian-laser-beams/PDA36A-Manual.pdf">PDA36A</a>
         (or <a

         Switchable Gain Amplified Photodetectors (we have both in the
         lab, so check the model number to know which one you are
         using). It is important to realize that data sheets (also
         called spec sheets or specification sheets) provide a model for
         the realistic behavior of the device. This model can be tested
         and improved, a process more commonly called “calibration.”
         Note that there are <strong>two</strong> power switches, one on
         the power supply and one on the photodetector. The
         photodetector will respond to light with the power off but it
         won’t work well and changing the gain will have little
         effect.</p>

         <ol type="1">
         <li>Spend a few minutes (no more than 10) to write an
         explanation using words and diagrams to explain the physical
         mechanism for how the photodetector converts light into
         voltage. You may use the manufacturer’s specifications sheet
         (linked to in the section above), trustworthy online resources,

         <p>When attempting to establish the validity of our

         lab classes tedious, rather it is a core part of any
         experimental work that gives us a way to quantify how much we
         trust our results.</p>
         <p>A simple and rigorous way to make a measurement and estimate
         its uncertainty is to take <span

         <p><em>If you are already comfortable with Python, NumPy, and
         Matplotlib, you may skip exercises you can confidently
         complete. Focus your time on the lab-specific analysis in Part

         <p>See the <a href="/PHYS-4430/python-resources">Python
         Resources</a> page if you need help getting started. You will
         need NumPy for numerical calculations and Matplotlib for
         plotting.</p>

         <p>These exercises directly support your beam width measurement
         and are <strong>essential preparation</strong> for Week 2.</p>
         <p><strong>Note on AI assistance:</strong> You may use AI tools
         to help write your curve fitting code. However, the learning
         goal is to understand what the code does and why. For each
         exercise, be prepared to explain: (1) what the fit parameters
         mean physically, (2) why the error function is the appropriate
         model, and (3) how to interpret the uncertainties reported by
         <code>curve_fit</code>.</p>

         <li><p><strong>Error function fitting practice.</strong>

         <li>If your uncertainty estimates from the oscilloscope RMS
         function and your manual sampling method disagree by a factor
         of 2, which would you trust more for your beam width
         measurement? Why?</li>
