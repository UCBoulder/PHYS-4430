         <p>In the first week of the guided Gaussian Beams lab, you
         learn about mounting optics and photodetectors and try out some
         techniques that are generally useful in optics labs and
         elsewhere. In particular, you will set up a simple optics
         system for measuring the width of a laser beam and in the
         process will have to mount and align the laser and optics.</p>
         <h1 data-number="2" id="lab-notebook"><span
         class="header-section-number">2</span> Lab Notebook</h1>
         <p>Your lab notebook will play an important role in this
         course. You will use your notebook for keeping records of many
         things including:</p>
         <ul>
         <li>Answering prelab questions from the lab guides</li>
         <li>Answering in-lab question from the lab guides</li>
         <li>Recording data</li>
         <li>Including plots of data</li>
         <li>Analysis and results</li>
         <li>Diagrams and pictures</li>
         <li>Procedures of experiments that you design</li>
         </ul>
         <p>The lab notebook will be an important part of your grade
         because learning to keep a good lab notebook is an important
         part of your professional development.</p>

         <p><strong>Optic</strong> – Any optical component that
         manipulates the light in some way. Examples include lenses,
         mirrors, polarizing filters, beam splitters, etc.</p>
         <p><strong>Optomechanics</strong> – This category includes
         optics mounts and the components to align them. Examples in the

         <p>Your group should find an empty optical breadboard
         workstation in one of the five color coded optics bays in
         G-214. Spend some time to explore the space and familiarize
         yourself with the components. The shelf above the breadboard
         should have:</p>
         <ul>
         <li>An oscilloscope</li>

         of optical components</h2>
         <p>It’s very important that you <strong>do not handle optical
         components</strong> (lenses, mirrors, polarizers, wave plates,
         beam splitters, etc.) <strong>with your bare hands</strong>.
         The oils on your skin can damage the optics and degrade the
         light in your experiment. Always handle these components while
         using <strong>latex/nitrile gloves or finger cots</strong>,
         which can be found on the top of the tool cabinets in your
         optics bay, or on top of the black drawer cabinets in the main
         lab. This <a
         href="https://www.newport.com/n/how-to-clean-optics">technical
         note</a> from Newport discusses how to go about cleaning dirty
         optics, and is also demonstrated in <a
         href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Pq4SeNmFYw">this
         video</a>. For a more in-depth treatment on cleaning optics, we
         have a copy of <a

         Proper Care of Optics: Cleaning, Handling, Storage, and

         <p>Now, we will begin assembling the components.</p>
         <ol type="1">
         <li>Get a laser and power supply from the “He-Ne Laser” drawer
         in the colored drawer cabinet found in your chosen or assigned
         optics bay. You’ll also need two sets of 3D-printed laser tube
         mounts which you can find in the same drawer (see Figure <a
         href="#fig:tube-mount">1</a>). The bottom mount first gets
         mounted to an optical post and then the top of the mount can be
         assembled with ¼-20 socket head cap screw and nut. After both
         sets of tube mounts are attached to the laser, insert the
         optical posts into post holders and attach the assembly to the
         optical table.</li>
         <li>Each person in your group is responsible for assembling a
         mirror as shown in Figure <a href="#fig:mount-assembley">2</a>.
         In the end, you will need at least 2 mirrors to complete the
         next task. <strong>Remember to wear latex/nitrile gloves or
         finger cots while handling optical components.</strong></li>
         </ol>
         <p><em>As you are mounting the optics, choose the heights so
         that the laser hits the center of each optic and the beam is
         parallel to the table.</em></p>

         <p>Next, you will align your laser such that beam is aligned
         parallel to the table. You will do this by using two mirrors
         and a technique that is called “walking a beam”. <a
         href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qzxILY6nOmA&amp;t=249s">This
         video</a> provides an overview on how to do so. The most
         relevant information for our lab starts at 4:09 (which the
         above link should take you to). Also, we have 3D printed beam
         alignment tools that are used in place of the iris in the
         video.</p>
         <ol type="1">
         <li>Mount two 3D printed beam alignment discs onto the optical
         table at the same height above the table.</li>
         <li>Use only two mirrors to get the beam to pass through the
         center of each disc. Having two mirrors allows you to
         independently adjust the angle and position of your beam.</li>
         <li>Draw a diagram in your lab notebook of the configuration of
         your laser, mirrors, and alignment discs.</li>

         <p>The goal of this part of the lab is to understand a lot
         about the specifications given on the datasheet for the
         Thorlabs <a
         href="../resources/lab-guides/Gaussian-Laser-Beams/PDA36A-Manual.pdf">PDA36A</a>
         (or <a

         Switchable Gain Amplified Photodetectors (we have both in the
         lab, so check the model number to know which one you are
         using). It is important to realize that data sheets (also
         called spec sheets or specification sheets) provide a model for
         the realistic behavior of the device. This model can be tested
         and improved, a process more commonly called “calibration.”
         Note that there are <strong>two</strong> power switches, one on
         the power supply and one on the photodetector. The
         photodetector will respond to light with the power off but it
         won’t work well and changing the gain will have little
         effect.</p>

         <ol type="1">
         <li>Spend a few minutes (no more than 10) to write an
         explanation using words and diagrams to explain the physical
         mechanism for how the photodetector converts light into
         voltage. You may use the manufacturer’s specifications sheet
         (linked to in the section above), trustworthy online resources,
         a book, etc.</li>
         <li>Use the data sheet to estimate the conversion of watts of
         light into amps of current for Helium-Neon red wavelength

         <p>Calibrating the photodetector is especially important when
         you take a data set that uses multiple gain settings. Having an
         accurate calibration of the gain and offset will let you stitch

         example, <span class="math inline">\(20\ dB\)</span> of gain
         corresponds to electronic voltage amplification by a factor of
         10. A <span class="math inline">\(dB\)</span> scale could also

         <ol type="1">

         Uncertainty</h1>
         <p>When attempting to establish the validity of our
         experimental results it is always important to quantify the
         uncertainty. Measurement uncertainty wasn’t invented to make
         lab classes tedious, rather it is a core part of any
         experimental work that gives us a way to quantify how much we
         trust our results.</p>
         <p>A simple and rigorous way to make a measurement and estimate
         its uncertainty is to take <span
         class="math inline">\(N\)</span> measurements <span
         class="math inline">\(\{y_1,y_2,\ ...\ ,y_N\}\)</span> and
         estimate the value by the mean:</p>
         <p><span class="math display">\[\overline{y} =
         \frac{1}{N}{\displaystyle
         \sum_{i=1}^{N}}y_i\text{.}\]</span></p>
         <p>The estimated uncertainty (standard deviation, <span
         class="math inline">\(\sigma_y\)</span>, or variance, <span
         class="math inline">\(\sigma_y^2\)</span>) of any one
         measurement is given by</p>

         \sum_{i=1}^{N}}(y_i-\overline{y})^2\text{,}\]</span></p>
         <p>while the uncertainty in the mean value <span
         class="math inline">\(\sigma_{\overline{y}}\)</span> is smaller
         and is given by</p>

         <p>The goal of this section is to develop a measurement
         technique and analysis scheme to measure the width of a laser
         beam. The scheme will let you measure the width in one
         dimension. The technique is most useful for beams that have an
         approximately Gaussian intensity profile. You will improve and
         refine this technique in the upcoming weeks of this lab.</p>
         <p>The basic scheme involves measuring the power in the laser
         beam as the beam is gradually blocked by a knife edge (razor
         blade) using a setup similar to Figure <a
