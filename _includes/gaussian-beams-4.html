         <p>In week one, we measured the profile of the laser and found
         it to be Gaussian to a good approximation. Last week, we
         derived the Gaussian beam model and learned how the profile
         changes as the beam propagates. This week, we will apply
         automation to more rapidly take data and test the model
         experimentally. The full set of learning goals includes:</p>

         <p>This week’s prelab focuses on preparing for automated data

         prelab, particularly the beam width equation:</p>
         <p><span
         class="math display">\[w(z)=w_0\sqrt{1+\left(\frac{\lambda
         z}{\pi w_0^2}\right)^2}\text{.}\]</span></p>
         <p>You will use this model to analyze your automated

         class="header-section-number">3</span> Automation of the
         Measurement</h1>
         <p>Before we begin this week’s lab, reflect on your experience
         from week one (and perhaps refer to your lab notebook entry to
         help guide your memory).</p>
         <ol type="1">
         <li>In week one, how long did the total process of data taking
         through analysis take to make a measurement of the beam width
         <span class="math inline">\(w\)</span>?</li>
         <li>In this lab, you may have to take 20-30 beam profiles in
         order to measure <span class="math inline">\(w_0\)</span> and
         <span class="math inline">\(z_w\)</span>. How long would this
         take with your current method?</li>
         <li>What are the most time consuming portions of the process?
         Which parts of the process would benefit from automation?</li>
         </ol>
         <p>In the next step, you will use Python and your NI USB-6009
         data acquisition device to automate the procedure for measuring
         the width of the laser beam. You can do this with your own
         laptop or with the laptops in the lab.</p>
         <p>In order to set up your measurement automation you will use
         a Python script that controls the motor and reads the
         photodetector. Instructions can be found in the Appendix <a
         href="#sec:python-automation">5</a>.</p>
         <ol start="4" type="1">
         <li>Test and run the automated Python program and evaluate the
         result using the same Python analysis from week one.</li>
         <li>Before you go on, make sure the automated acquisition and
         analysis routine gives the same result as the method you used
         in week one.</li>
         <li>How long does your new measurement method take? (2-3
         minutes per <span class="math inline">\(w\)</span> measurement
         is very good.)</li>

         <p>The Gaussian beam model of light is useful because it often
         describes the beam of light created by lasers. This section
         will test the validity of the model for our He-Ne laser beam.
         Also, the effect of a lens on a Gaussian beam will be tested,
         and the Gaussian beam model will be compared with predictions
         from the simpler ray theory. Lastly, the Gaussian beam theory
         can be used to describe the minimum possible focus size for a
         beam and a lens.</p>

         class="header-section-number">4.1</span> Measuring the beam
         profile of your He-Ne laser without any lenses</h2>
         <p>There is a straight-forward reason that a He-Ne laser should
         produce a Gaussian beam. The laser light builds up between two
         mirrors, and the electromagnetic mode that best matches the
         shape of the mirrors is the Gaussian beam.</p>
         <ol type="1">
         <li>Considering the Gaussian beam equations from Week 3’s
         prelab (the electric field, beam width <span
         class="math inline">\(w(z)\)</span>, radius of curvature <span
         class="math inline">\(R(z)\)</span>, and Gouy phase <span
         class="math inline">\(\zeta(z)\)</span>), which aspects of the
         Gaussian beam model can you test? Are there any parts of the
         model you cannot test?</li>
         <li>Measure the beam width <span
         class="math inline">\(w\)</span> at various distances from the
         laser. Consider carefully what distance should be varying. Is
         it the distance from laser to razor, the distance from razor to
         photodetector, or the distance from laser to photodetector? How
         did you decide what positions <span
         class="math inline">\(z\)</span> to measure the width at (meter
         sticks and other measurement tools are available in the
         lab)?</li>
         <li>Fit the data to <span class="math inline">\(w(z)\)</span>,
         the predicted expression for a Gaussian beam: <span

         <li>What is the value of the beam waist <span

         Where does the beam waist <span

         <p>Pick a non-compound lens (not the fancy camera lenses) with
         focal length in the range 100-200 mm and assemble it in a lens
         mount with a retaining ring (see Figure <a
         href="#fig:mount-assembley">1</a>). Recall that it’s very
         important that you <strong>do not handle optical
         components</strong> (lenses, mirrors, polarizers, wave plates,
         beam splitters, etc.) <strong>with your bare hands</strong>.
         The oils on your skin can damage the optics and degrade the
         light in your experiment. Always handle these components while
         using <strong>latex/nitrile gloves or finger cots</strong>.</p>
         <p>Design and carry out an experiment to quantitatively answer
         the questions below. Consider carefully where to put the lens.
         Your data for this section can be used in the next section.</p>
         <ol type="1">
         <li>Insert a lens (after the mirrors) into the beam path to
         change the divergence/convergence of the beam but keep its
         propagation direction the same.</li>
         <li>When this condition (the beam propagation direction is
         unchanged) is met, where does the beam intersect the lens?
         <em>Note: This is the preferred method of adding a lens to an

         Parameters</h3>
         <p><strong>Step Size</strong>: Smaller step sizes give higher
         resolution but take longer: - 0.05 mm is a good starting point
         for most beams - Use smaller steps (0.02-0.03 mm) for tightly
         focused beams - You can use larger steps (0.1 mm) for initial
         alignment</p>
         <p><strong>Wait Time</strong>: This ensures measurements are
         taken after vibrations settle: - Use kinematic equation to
         estimate: <span class="math inline">\(x =
         \frac{1}{2}at^2\)</span> - For 0.05 mm step and 1 mm/s²
         acceleration: <span class="math inline">\(t = \sqrt{2 \times
         0.05/1} \approx 316\)</span> ms - Add safety margin: 500 ms is
         usually sufficient - Increase if you see noisy data</p>

         <ol type="1">
         <li><p><strong>Starting Position</strong>: Position the razor
         so the beam is fully unblocked. Use the manual jog controls on
         the KST101 to find a good starting point.</p></li>
         <li><p><strong>Scan Range</strong>: Make sure your scan covers
         the full transition from unblocked to fully blocked. Include
         some data before and after the transition.</p></li>
         <li><p><strong>Real-Time Monitoring</strong>: Watch the live
         plot as data comes in. You can press Ctrl+C to stop early if
         something looks wrong.</p></li>
         <li><p><strong>Data Validation</strong>: Before collecting many
         profiles, take one measurement manually and one with
         automation. Compare results to ensure consistency.</p></li>
         <li><p><strong>File Organization</strong>: The script includes
         timestamps in filenames, but consider adding descriptive
         prefixes (e.g., by modifying the <code>filename</code>
         variable) to help organize your data.</p></li>
