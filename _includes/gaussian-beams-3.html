         <p>In week 1, we measured the profile of the laser and found it
         to be Gaussian to a good approximation. However, we don’t have
         any model for how the profile changes as the beam propagates
         and we will work to improve our model. Also, we will apply
         automation to more rapidly take data. The full set of learning

         <p>Light is a propagating oscillation of the electromagnetic
         field. The general principles which govern electromagnetic
         waves are Maxwell’s equations. From these general relations, a
         vector wave equation can be derived.</p>
         <p><span id="eq:1" class="eqnos"><span class="math display">\[
         \nabla^2\vec{E}=\mu_0\epsilon_0
         \frac{\partial^2\vec{E}}{\partial
         t^2}\text{.}\]</span><span class="eqnos-number">(1)</span></span>
         </p>
         <p>One of the simplest solutions is that of a plane wave
         propagating in the <span class="math inline">\(\hat{z}\)</span>
         direction:</p>
         <p><span id="eq:2" class="eqnos"><span
         class="math display">\[\vec{E}(x,y,z,t)=E_x\hat{x}cos(kz-\omega
         t+\phi_x)+E_y\hat{y}cos(kz-\omega
         t+\phi_y)\text{.}\quad\quad\]</span><span class="eqnos-number">(2)</span></span>
         </p>
         <p>But as the measurements from the first week showed, our
         laser beams are commonly well approximated by a beam shape with
         a Gaussian intensity profile. Apparently, since these Gaussian
         profile beams exist, they must be solutions of the wave
         equation. The next section will discuss how we derive the
         Gaussian beam electric field, and give a few key results.</p>
         <h2 data-number="2.1" id="sec:wave-eqn"><span
         class="header-section-number">2.1</span> Paraxial wave
         equation</h2>
         <p>One important thing to note about the beam output from most
         lasers is that the width of the beam changes very slowly
         compared to the wavelength of light. Assume a complex solution,
         where the beam is propagating in the <span
         class="math inline">\(\hat{z}\)</span>-direction, with the
         electric field polarization in the <span
         class="math inline">\(\hat{x}\)</span>-direction:</p>
         <p><span id="eq:3" class="eqnos"><span
         class="math display">\[\vec{E}(x,y,z,t)=\hat{x}A(x,y,z)e^{kz-\omega
         t}\text{.}\]</span><span class="eqnos-number">(3)</span></span>
         </p>
         <p>The basic idea is that the spatial pattern of the beam,
         described by the function <span
         class="math inline">\(A(x,y,z)\)</span>, does not change much
         over a wavelength. In the case of the He-Ne laser output, the
         function <span class="math inline">\(A(x,y,z)\)</span> is a
         Gaussian profile that changes its width as a function of <span
         class="math inline">\(z\)</span>. If we substitute the trial
         solution in Equation <a href="#eq:3">3</a> into the wave
         equation in Equation <a href="#eq:1">1</a> we get</p>
         <p><span id="eq:4" class="eqnos"><span
         class="math display">\[\hat{x} \left[
         \left(\frac{\partial^2A}{\partial x^2}
         +\frac{\partial^2A}{\partial y^2} +\frac{\partial^2A}{\partial
         z^2} \right) +2ik\frac{\partial A}{\partial z} - k^2A
         \right]e^{i(kz-\omega
         t)}=\hat{x}\mu_0\epsilon_oA(-\omega^2)e^{i(kz-\omega
         t)}\text{.}\quad\quad\]</span><span class="eqnos-number">(4)</span></span>
         </p>
         <p>This can be simplified recognizing that <span
         class="math inline">\(k^2=\omega^2/c^2=\mu_0\epsilon_0\omega^2\)</span>,
         where the speed of light is related to the permeability and
         permittivity of free space by <span
         class="math inline">\(c=(\mu_0\epsilon_0)^{-1/2}\)</span>.
         Also, the <span class="math inline">\(\hat{x}e^{i(kz-\omega
         t)}\)</span> term is common to both sides and can be dropped,
         which results in</p>
         <p><span id="eq:5" class="eqnos"><span
         class="math display">\[\left(\frac{\partial^2A}{\partial x^2}
         +\frac{\partial^2A}{\partial y^2} +\frac{\partial^2A}{\partial
         z^2} \right) +2ik\frac{\partial A}{\partial
         z}=0\text{.}\quad\quad\]</span><span class="eqnos-number">(5)</span></span>
         </p>
         <p>So far, we have made no approximation to the solution or the
         wave equation, but now we apply the assumption that <span
         class="math inline">\(\partial{A}(x,y,z)/\partial{z}\)</span>
         changes slowly over a wavelength <span
         class="math inline">\(\lambda = 2\pi /k\)</span>, so we neglect
         the term</p>
         <p><span id="eq:6" class="eqnos"><span
         class="math display">\[\left| \frac{\partial^2A}{\partial z^2}
         \right| \ll \left|2k\frac{\partial A}{\partial
         z}\right|\text{.}\]</span><span class="eqnos-number">(6)</span></span>
         </p>
         <p>Finally, we get the paraxial wave equation,</p>
         <p><span id="eq:7" class="eqnos"><span
         class="math display">\[\frac{\partial^2A}{\partial x^2}
         +\frac{\partial^2A}{\partial y^2} +\frac{\partial^2A}{\partial
         z^2}=0\text{.}\]</span><span class="eqnos-number">(7)</span></span>
         </p>
         <p>One set of solutions to the paraxial wave equation are
         Gauss-Hermite beams, which have an intensity profiles like
         those shown in Figure <a href="#fig:gauss-hermite">1</a>. These
         are the same solutions as for the quantum simple harmonic
         oscillator, a topic that could be further explored as a final
         project.</p>
         <p>The simplest of these solutions is the Gaussian beam, which
         has an electric field given by</p>
         <p><span id="eq:8" class="eqnos"><span
         class="math display">\[\vec{E}(x,y,z,t) =
         \vec{E}_0\frac{w_0}{w(z)}exp\left(-\frac{x^2+y^2}{w^2(z)}\right)exp\left(ik\frac{x^2+y^2}{2R(z)}\right)e^{-i\zeta(z)}e^{i(kz-\omega
         t)}\text{,}\quad\quad\]</span><span class="eqnos-number">(8)</span></span>
         </p>
         <p>where <span class="math inline">\(\vec{E_0}\)</span> is a
         time-independent vector (orthogonal to propagation direction
         <span class="math inline">\(\hat{z}\)</span>) whose magnitude
         denotes the amplitude of the laser’s electric field and the
         direction denotes the direction of polarization. The beam
         radius <span class="math inline">\(w(z)\)</span>is given by</p>
         <p><span id="eq:9" class="eqnos"><span
         class="math display">\[w(z)=w_0\sqrt{1+\left(\frac{\lambda
         z}{\pi
         w_0^2}\right)^2}\text{.}\]</span><span class="eqnos-number">(9)</span></span>
         </p>
         <p><span class="math inline">\(R(z)\)</span>,the radius of
         curvature of the wavefront, is given by</p>
         <p><span id="eq:10" class="eqnos"><span
         class="math display">\[R(z)=z\left(1+\left(\frac{\pi
         w_0^2}{\lambda
         z}\right)^2\right)\text{,}\]</span><span class="eqnos-number">(10)</span></span>
         </p>
         <p>and the Gouy phase is given by</p>
         <p><span id="eq:11" class="eqnos"><span
         class="math display">\[\zeta(z)=arctan\frac{\pi w_0^2}{\lambda
         z}\text{.}\]</span><span class="eqnos-number">(11)</span></span>
         </p>
         <p>The remarkable thing about all these equations is that only
         two parameters need to be specified to give the whole beam
         profile: the wavelength <span
         class="math inline">\(\lambda\)</span> and the beam waist <span
         class="math inline">\(w_0\)</span>, which is the narrowest
         point in the beam profile. There is a more general set of
         Hermite Gaussian modes which are shown in Figure <a
         href="#fig:gauss-hermite">1</a>. The laser cavity typically
         produces the (0,0) mode shown in the upper left corner, but an
         optical cavity can also be used to create these other modes – a
         topic that can be explored in the final projects.</p>

         <p>For the output beam of one of the lasers in the lab, a fit
         of beam width versus position gave the following fit
         parameters:</p>
         <p><span class="math display">\[z_0 = -0.03 \pm 0.04 \

         <p><span class="math display">\[w_0=(1.90 \pm 0.09)\times
         10^{-6} \ m\]</span></p>

         <p>The error bar is a graphical way to display the uncertainty
         in a measurement. In order to put error bars on a plot you must
         first estimate the error for each point. Anytime you include
         error bars in a plot you should explain how the uncertainty in
         each point was estimated (e.g., you “eyeballed” the
         uncertainty, or you sampled it <span
         class="math inline">\(N\)</span> times and took the standard
         deviation of the mean, etc.)</p>

         class="header-section-number">2.4.1</span> Error bars in
         Mathematica</h3>
         <p>Creating plots with error bars in Mathematica requires the
         use of the <code>ErrorBarPlots</code> package. Suppose you had
         estimated the uncertainty at every point in a width measurement
         of your Gaussian laser beam to be <span
         class="math inline">\(0.04 \ V\)</span>. This error was chosen
         to demonstrate the mechanics of making a plot with error bars,
         but the uncertainty in the actual data was probably smaller
         than this. Also, there is no reason to believe it was the same
         at low and high voltages. The data and uncertainty form a three
         column data set as seen in Table <a

         help guide your memory).</p>

         <p>In order to set up your measurement automation you will need

         (moving the translation stage, recording the position,

         will test the validity of the model for our He-Ne laser beam.
         Also, the effect of a lens on a Gaussian beam will be tested,
         and the Gaussian beam model will be compared with predictions
         from the simpler ray theory. Lastly, the Gaussian beam theory
         can be used to describe the minimum possible focus size for a
         beam and a lens.</p>

         Windows APT software <a
         href="https://www.thorlabs.com/software_pages/ViewSoftwarePage.cfm?Code=Motion_Control">here</a>
         in order to get the MGMotor library used below. Once you have
         done this, follow the next steps:</p>
         <ol type="1">
         <li>Start with LabVIEW closed on your computer and no cords
         connected to the motor cube.</li>
         <li>Connect the USB to the KST101 controller cube, THEN turn on
         the power.</li>
         <li>Open APT Config on the computer. Your motor should be seen
         by the software. Click the motor drop down menu and select your
         motor. Now, in the drop down menu for Stage, find ZST225(B) and
         select it. With these options in place, select the Add/Change
         Stage Association button.</li>
         <li>Close APT Config.</li>
         </ol>
         <p>This should connect the motor correctly, but to verify, open
         APT User. This will open a LabVIEW VI with a motor control on
         the front panel. This motor control should have your serial
         number in the top right corner and should also have “STAGE:
         ZST225(B)”. Clicking the arrow pointing up and arrow pointing
         down should move the motor in either direction. If none of this
         is seen when you open APT User, the motor was not set up
         correctly and you should disconnect the USB and power supply
         from the motor and start again at Step 1.</p>

         implementation</h2>
         <p>To understand how to automate the data taking process using
         LabVIEW, consider what you do while taking data by hand. The
         process includes: moving the razor (stage), reading the
         position, reading the photodiode voltage, repeat. In order to
         automate this process, two pieces of equipment are used: the
         motor to move the stage and the NI-DAQ to read the voltage.</p>
         <p>The first step in data taking is moving the razor. To
         automate this, we need to use the motor cube. To connect the
         cube to LabVIEW, follow these steps:</p>
         <ol type="1">
         <li>On the front panel, place an <code>ActiveX Container</code>
         (Under the “.NET &amp; ActiveX” tab)</li>
         <li>Right click the
         <code>ActiveX Container &gt; Insert ActiveX Object ... &gt; MGMotor Control</code></li>
         <li>Right click <code>MG17Motor</code>in the block diagram
         <code>&gt; Create &gt; Property for MG17MotorLib… &gt; HWSerialNum</code></li>
         <li>Right click <code>HWSerialNum &gt; Change to Write</code>
         <ol type="1">
         <li>Wire the <code>MG17Motor</code> reference out to the
         reference in of <code>HWSerialNum</code>. This allows us to
         tell the LabVIEW to look for the motor cube with your serial
         number (i.e. your cube).</li>
         </ol></li>
         <li>Add a Numerical Control to the front panel.
         <ol type="1">
         <li>Rename to <code>HWSerialNum</code></li>
         <li>In the block diagram, wire it to the input of
         <code>HWSerialNum</code>. This control allows you to input your
         motor’s serial number easily on the front panel in case you
         change cubes.</li>
         </ol></li>
         <li>Right click <code>MG17Motor</code> in block diagram

         <li>At this point, our LabVIEW is basically saying “Look for a
         motor with <em>this</em> serial number (input in the front
         panel numerical control) and start controlling it.” Now we have
         to make it move.</li>

         <ol type="1">
         <li>This node allows us to tell the motor how much to move and
         it uses units of millimeters.</li>

         <li>Rename one to <em>Max Velocity (mm/s)</em> and wire it in

         <li>Rename the last numerical constant <em>Acceleration

         <li>These control how the motor moves. They should be set to a

         an acceleration of 1 mm/s/s.</li>
         </ol></li>
         </ol>
         <p>The next step involves the action that we want the motor to
         execute, as well as the data taking process:</p>
         <ol type="1">
         <li><p>In order to separate the ‘action’ part of the LabVIEW
         from the ‘initialization’, first add a
         <code>Flat Sequence Structure</code> in the block diagram under
         the <code>Structures</code> tab.</p>
         <ol type="1">
         <li>Drag the <code>Flat Sequence Structure</code> to include
         everything in the block diagram so far (the initialization
         part).</li>
         <li>Right click the <code>Flat Sequence Structure</code> and
         select <code>Add Frame After</code>. The second frame in this
         sequence loop will contain all the action of moving the motor
         and taking the data.</li>
         </ol></li>
         <li><p>The data taking process has one key feature that should
         be addressed at this point, the “repeat” part (Move razor, take
         data, repeat). In order to make our LabVIEW repeat this
         process:</p>
         <ol type="1">
         <li>Add a <code>While Loop</code> (from the
         <code>Structures</code> tab) inside the second frame of the
         Sequence.</li>
         <li>Add a <code>Stop</code> button to the front panel and, in
         the block diagram, wire the stop button to the red stop circle
         in the corner of the <code>While Loop</code>. This loop will
         execute its contents repeatedly <em>while</em> the loop has a
         Boolean “true” value. Once the LabVIEW is running, pressing
         this stop button on the front panel will stop the While Loop
         from continuing.</li>
         </ol></li>
         <li><p>We need to put our other actions inside this
         <code>While Loop</code>. We want these actions to be performed
         in a sequence, so inside the <code>While Loop</code>, add
         another <code>Flat Sequence Structure</code> (we will refer to
         this loop as sequence #2).</p>
         <ol type="1">
         <li>Add 3 frames to sequence #2 for a total of 4 frames.</li>
         </ol></li>
         <li><p>Inside the first frame of sequence #2, we want the razor
         to move one Jog Step.</p>
         <ol type="1">
         <li>Right click
         <code>MG17Motor &gt; Create &gt; Method for MG17MotorLib… &gt; MoveJog</code>
         and place inside 1st frame of sequence #2.</li>
         <li>Wire <strong>reference out</strong> from
         <code>SetJogStep</code> node to <strong>reference in</strong>
         of <code>MoveJog</code>.</li>
         <li>Add a Numerical Constant of 0 to the block diagram and wire
         it to the <strong>IChanID</strong> input.</li>
         <li>Add one Numerical Control to the front panel and rename it
         <em>Jog Direction</em>.</li>
         <li>Wire it to the <strong>IJogDir</strong> input and enter its
         value as either 1 or 2 (the values correspond to extending or
         retracting).</li>
         </ol></li>
         <li><p>The next step in the data taking process to wait some
         amount of time to ensure we do not read the photodiode voltage
         while the razor is moving.</p>
         <ol type="1">
         <li>Add the <code>Wait</code> function (under the
         <code>Timing</code> tab) to the 2nd frame of sequence #2.</li>
         <li>Add a Numerical Control to the front panel, rename it
         <em>Wait (ms)</em>.</li>
         <li>Wire this control to the <code>Wait</code> function. This
         allows you to change the wait time from the front panel.</li>
         </ol></li>
         <li><p>At this point we need to introduce the NI-DAQ. First,
         find a working DAQ. Plug it into the computer via the USB. Wire
         the BNC output from the photodiode into the +/- analog inputs
         of the DAQ labeled AI0.</p>
         <ol type="1">

         <code>Acquire Signal &gt; Analog Input &gt; Voltage &gt; Channels ai0</code>.</li>
         <li>A new window should pop up for additional setting options
         called DAQ Assist Properties. Under <em>Timing Settings</em>,
         change the <em>Acquisition Mode</em> to <em>1 Sample (On

         <li>Click OK to close the window and save your settings.</li>
         </ol></li>
         <li><p>In the 4th frame of sequence #2 select
         <code>File I/O &gt; Write to Measurement File</code></p></li>
         <li><p>A window should open for properties of this node, if it
         does not then right click the Write to Measurement File icon
         and select “Properties”.</p>
         <ol type="1">
         <li>Under the <em>Filename</em> section, select <em>Ask User to
         Choose</em> and check the box <em>Ask Only Once</em>. This
         allows you to enter the file name when LabVIEW is run.</li>
         <li>Under <em>If a file already exists</em> select <em>Append
         to file</em>. This makes it so each data point is added to the
         same file, instead of overwriting or deleting old data
         points.</li>
         <li>The file format should be left as text format because it’s
         easiest to upload into Mathematica.</li>
         <li>Under the header option, select <em>No Headers</em>. At
         this point all the settings should be as we want so close this
         window.</li>
         </ol></li>
         <li><p>Now we need to feed our data into this icon so it knows
         what to write to file. The data that we want should be in the
         form (position, voltage).</p>
         <ol type="1">
         <li>In sequence #2 frame 4 add
         <code>Express &gt; Sig. Manip. &gt; Merge Signals</code>.</li>
         </ol></li>
         <li><p>This merged signal will output to the Write to File node
         and we want the position value in the upper input of Merge
         Signals and the voltage value in lower input.</p>
         <ol type="1">
         <li>Wire the <strong>Data</strong> output from the

         <li>Add a Numerical Indicator on the front panel and rename it
         <em>Voltage (V)</em> and wire the data output of the
         <code>DAQ-Assist</code> to it in the 3rd frame of sequence #2
         in the block diagram. This provides a real-time check of the
         photodiode voltage from the front panel.</li>
         </ol></li>
         <li><p>We want to know the position of the stage. Right click

         input of the <code>Write to File</code> node.</p></li>
         </ol>
         <p>And with that, the LabVIEW setup is complete!</p>
         <p>At this point, take a step back and take a look at the big
         picture of the LabVIEW and how it operates. There are many
         different approaches to automating this specific process and
         there is always more than one way to approach any problem. In
         this case what we did was we broke up the LabVIEW into 2 major
         parts; the initialization and the action. To initialize, we
         said “look for a motor with <em>this</em> serial number, start
         controlling it and set its jog step size to be <em>this</em>
         size.” With that done, we move to the action part. The While
         Loop says “continue doing this until I press the stop button”
         and what we are telling it to do is; move the razer, wait for
         it to stop moving, read the photodiode voltage and combine it
         with the position measurement, and finally write the data to a
         file. Once it executes that process the While Loop starts it
         all over again.</p>
         <p>Some tips on how to actually use the LabVIEW.</p>
         <ol type="1">
         <li>Make sure the move velocity on the motor control cube is
         maxed out at 1mm/s. This is changed on the motor cube itself
         through the menu.</li>
         <li>The Jog Step Size can be very small (0.05 mm for
         example).</li>
         <li>To determine a good amount of time to wait, you can start
         with the kinematic equation: <span class="math inline">\(x =
         1/2 a t^2\)</span>. For a step size of 0.05mm, this indicates a
         time of 316 ms. You may also need to worry about the maximum
         velocity if you have a large step size. In general, you
         probably want to add another 200 ms for safety. This will
         ensure that vibrations from the movement have damped out.</li>
         <li>Check where a good starting position is on the control cube
         display. Then, once a data set is taken you can quickly move
         the motor to the start position using the control wheel on the
         cube. You definitely want to include data before, during, and
         after the razor starts to block the light.</li>
         </ol>
         <p>The final LabVIEW requires you to input the serial number,
         step size, and wait time on the front panel. With those values
         in place, running the LabVIEW and selecting the file save
         location are all that needs to be done to start the process. To
         stop, press the stop button and it will cut off the While Loop
         and end the process.</p>

         interact, you can look <a

         <h1 data-number="6" id="sec:err-prop"><span
         class="header-section-number">6</span> Appendix: Error
         Propagation - from Measured to Derived Quantities</h1>
         <p>The quantity of interest in an experiment is often derived
         from other measured quantities. An example is estimating the
         resistance of a circuit element from measurements of current
         and voltage, using Ohm’s law (<span
         class="math inline">\(R=V/I\)</span>) to convert our measured
         quantities (voltage and current) into a derived quantity
         (resistance).</p>
         <p>Error propagation comes in when we want to estimate the
         uncertainty in the derived quantity based on the uncertainties
         in the measured quantities. Keeping things general, suppose we
         want to derive a quantity <span
         class="math inline">\(z\)</span> from a set of measured
         quantities <span class="math inline">\(a,b,c, \ ... \
         \)</span>. The mathematical function which gives us <span
         class="math inline">\(z\)</span> is <span
         class="math inline">\(z=z(a,b,c, \ ... \ )\)</span>. In
         general, any fluctuation in the measured quantities <span
         class="math inline">\(a,b,c, \ ... \ \)</span> will cause a
         fluctuation in <span class="math inline">\(z\)</span> according
         to</p>
         <p><span class="math display">\[\delta z = \left(
         \frac{\partial z}{\partial a}\right)\delta a+\left(
         \frac{\partial z}{\partial b}\right)\delta b+\left(
         \frac{\partial z}{\partial c}\right)\delta c+ \
         ...\text{.}\quad\quad\]</span></p>
         <p>This equation comes straight from basic calculus. It’s like
         the first term in a Taylor series. It’s the linear
         approximation of <span class="math inline">\(z(a,b,c, \ ... \
         )\)</span> near <span class="math inline">\((a_0,b_0,c_0, \ ...
         \ )\)</span>. However, we don’t know the exact magnitude or
         sign of the fluctuations, rather we just can estimate the
         spread in <span class="math inline">\(\delta a, \delta b,
         \delta c, \ ... \ \)</span>, which we often use the standard
         deviations <span class="math inline">\(\sigma_a, \sigma_b,
         \sigma_c, \ ... \ \)</span> In this case, the propagated
         uncertainty in <span class="math inline">\(z\)</span> is:</p>
         <p><span class="math display">\[\sigma_z^2 = \left(
         \frac{\partial z}{\partial a}\right)^2\sigma_a^2+\left(
         \frac{\partial z}{\partial b}\right)^2\sigma_b^2+\left(
         \frac{\partial z}{\partial c}\right)^2\sigma_c^2+ \
         ...\text{.}\quad\quad\]</span></p>
         <p>There are standard equations provided in courses like the
         introductory physics lab for the error in the sum, difference,
         product, quotient. These are all easily derived from the
         general formula.</p>
