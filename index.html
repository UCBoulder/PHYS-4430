         <h2 class="title">Welcome to PHYS 4430 - About the Course</h2>
         
          PHYS 4430, Advanced Laboratory at the University of Colorado Boulder, is designed to expose you to and equip you with some of the essential skills 
          that an experimentalist should have. It is also designed to expose you to a variety of experimental physics topics, 
          and to provide a sense of independent research.
          <br>
          <br>
          The first 10 weeks of the course consists of five guided experiments. A short oral presentation or written report follows 
          the completion of each of these five experiments. About mid-semester, students individually or in small teams begin to 
          conceive of independent experimental research projects covering any field relevant to experimental physics. This project is 
          the focus of weeks 11-15. The instructors make every effort to support original and creative projects. At the end of the 
          semester, the student submits a written project report and also gives an oral presentation.

          <p><strong>Lectures:</strong> Lectures are on Tuesday and
          Thursday each week in the classroom of Duane G214. See below
          for the lecture times for each section. Lectures will not be
          recorded but the slides used will be <a
          href="https://canvas.colorado.edu/">posted in Canvas</a>.</p>
          <ul>
          <li>Section 200 - Tuesdays and Thursdays from 9:00 am to 9:50
          am</li>
          <li>Section 100 - Tuesdays and Thursdays from 1:00 pm to 1:50
          pm</li>
          </ul>
          <p><strong>Lab Sessions:</strong> Each section has one
          three-hour instructional lab session per week, supervised by
          your lab instructor. You must attend the weekly scheduled lab
          session that corresponds with the section you are enrolled
          in.</p>
          <ul>
          <li>Section 201 - Tuesdays from 10:00 am to 12:50 pm</li>
          <li>Section 101 - Thursdays from 2:00 pm to 4:50 pm</li>
          </ul>
          <h2 id="textbook-and-reference-materials">Textbook and
          Reference Materials</h2>
          <p><em>There is no required textbook for this course.</em> The
          following textbooks are available in the lab for your
          reference (please do not remove them from the lab).</p>
          <ul>
          <li><em><strong>Experiments in Modern Physics</strong>, A.
          Melissinos and J. Napolitano, Academic Press, 2nd ed.,
          2003</em>. (The 1st edition from 1966 is dated in some parts
          but still very useful.)</li>
          <li><em><strong>The Art of Experimental Physics</strong>, D.
          W. Preston and E. R. Dietz, John Wiley &amp; Sons, 1991.</em>
          This is extremely useful for the basic skills in experimental
          physics.</li>
          <li><em><strong>Building Scientific Apparatus</strong>: A
          practical guide to design and construction</em>, <em>John H.
          Moore, Christopher C. Davis and Michael A. Coplan, Perseus
          Books, Cambridge, MA, 3rd edition, 2003.</em> This text is a
          valuable resource for experimentalists. Although there are no
          planned specific assignments from the book, its utility will
          vastly outlive the semester.</li>
          </ul>
          <h2 id="group-work">Group Work</h2>
          <p>Students can anticipate working in small groups (typically
          two students per group) throughout the semester. For the first
          guided lab (Gaussian Laser Beams), students will choose their
          groups. Groups for the remainder of the guided labs will be
          assigned based on your requested lab experiments and other
          factors. It can be expected that group assignments will not be
          static for each guided lab. Students also work in small groups
          for the final project, although some students do work
          independently on this portion of the course. This is
          determined later in the semester by a collaboration between
          the students, instructors, and technical staff when the final
          project ideas are realized.</p>
          <p>Lab notebooks, prelab assignments, lab skill activities,
          and written reports should be your own work. If you work on
          the oral presentation together, submitting identical
          presentations is allowed. For final project proposal draft,
          proposal, project report and presentations, one submission per
          team should be fine.</p>
          <h2 id="lab-organization">Lab Organization</h2>
          <p>The laboratory equipment, electronic and optical
          components, and tools are organized and labeled. The optics
          rooms and the electronics lab are equipped with kits of
          components for the standard experiments. There is a single
          location in the lab for other components or equipment. Please
          tour the lab and familiarize yourself with the location of
          these items.</p>
          <p>The lab is to be maintained in the condition in which it
          begins the semester. Of course, while equipment, tools and
          components can be collected and kept during the course of an
          experiment, they are to be returned to their homes when the
          experiment is finished.</p>
          <p>If you have any questions, please reach out to the
          technical staff. They are here to help and welcome all
          questions.</p>
          <h2 id="lab-availability-and-use">Lab Availability and
          Use</h2>
          <p>The course will go much more smoothly (and quickly) for you
          if you are well prepared for each lab session so you can get
          most of the work done while your instructor is available to
          help. Remember to clean up your area when you are finished as
          the space is shared between all the lab sections. Communal
          equipment, including meters, stop watches, tools from the
          bench, cables, etc. should be returned to their storage
          locations. The lab is open for unsupervised work any time the
          building wing is open, and when no other session is in
          progress. These times are available for you to complete
          unfinished experiments or to explore your own ideas. Your Buff
          One Card will open the lab door. Please do not prop open the
          lab door or the hallway barrier door: doing so will result in
          a warning and then loss of keycard access to the lab. If you
          are the last to leave the lab, please turn off all equipment,
          close any windows, turn off the lights, and make sure the door
          closes and latches when you leave the lab.</p>
          <h2 id="broken-andor-malfunctioning-equipment">Broken and/or
          Malfunctioning Equipment</h2>
          <p>Lab equipment may fail, malfunction, or become damaged
          throughout the semester. If this happens, please report it to
          the lab technical staff by completing <a
          href="https://canvas.colorado.edu/courses/88986/pages/report-lab-issue">this
          form</a> and report it to you instructor. The lab issue form
          allows you to also submit attachments which helps the
          technical staff identify and troubleshoot the issue.</p>
          <h2 id="machine-shop-course">Machine Shop Course</h2>
          <p>As part of your enrollment in this course, we offer to
          cover the costs associated with taking the <a
          href="https://www.colorado.edu/physics/partners/trades-teaching-lab/classes">Machining
          Course</a> in the <a
          href="https://www.colorado.edu/physics/partners/trades-teaching-lab">Physics
          Trades Teaching Lab</a>. While this is not a requirement, we
          strongly encourage all students to participate in this
          opportunity. More details will be provided later in the
          semester.</p>
